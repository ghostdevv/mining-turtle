# Mining Turtle

A simple script to mine an area, builds on the idea of the `tunnel` command but allows for the size area to be defined.

## Installation

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostdevv/mining-turtle/main/mine.lua
```

## Usage

The turtle must be placed in the bottom right corner facing the direction you want to mine. It'll also automatically refuel on startup.

```bash
mine <width> <height> <depth>
```
